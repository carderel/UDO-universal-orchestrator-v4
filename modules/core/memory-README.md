# Memory System

Organized memory to prevent confusion between facts, speculation, and scratch work.

## Folders

### /working/
- Current session scratch space
- Cleared at end of each session
- Use for: intermediate calculations, draft ideas, temporary notes

### /canonical/
- Verified, permanent facts
- Only add after explicit validation
- Use for: confirmed requirements, validated data, established decisions

### /disposable/
- Hypotheses and speculation
- Delete when validated or rejected
- Use for: assumptions being tested, unconfirmed information

## Rules
1. Never treat working memory as fact
2. Always note source when adding to canonical
3. Delete disposable memory once resolved
4. When unsure: "Is this verified or speculation?"
