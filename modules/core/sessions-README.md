# Sessions

This folder contains session handoff documents - the critical context for AI continuity.

## For New AIs

**Read the most recent file in this folder first.**

Each session log contains:
- **Tags** for quick topic scanning (e.g., #api #authentication #bugfix)
- What was accomplished
- Decisions made
- Current blockers
- What to do next
- Files that changed

## Finding Relevant Sessions

Sessions are tagged with topics. To find past context:
1. Scan the `Tags:` line at the top of each session
2. Look for sessions with matching tags
3. Read those sessions for relevant context

## Also Check

- `../handoffs/` - Agent-to-agent handoffs that may need completion
- `../../PROJECT_STATE.json` - Current todo status

## File Naming

Files are named: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-handoff.md`

Sort by name to find the most recent.
